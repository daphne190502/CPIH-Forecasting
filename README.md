# Economic Indicators Analysis in the UK

## Overview
This project analyzes the impact of significant events, such as Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic, on key economic indicators in the UK. Specifically, we focus on the Consumer Price Index including Owner Occupier’s Housing Cost (CPIH), unemployment rates, and Average Weekly Earnings (AWE). By leveraging datasets from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), we aim to understand trends, establish correlations, and predict future values of these indicators.

## Objectives
'''• Analyze the trends and patterns in CPIH, unemployment rates, and AWE.  
• Establish correlations between economic indicators.
• Predict future values using advanced machine learning models.
• Validate predictions made by economists and organizations.
• Provide insights for policymakers, investors, and businesses affected by economic fluctuations.
