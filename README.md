# Economic Indicators Analysis in the UK

## Overview
This project analyzes the impact of significant events, such as Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic, on key economic indicators in the UK. Specifically, we focus on the Consumer Price Index including Owner Occupierâ€™s Housing Cost (CPIH), unemployment rates, and Average Weekly Earnings (AWE). By leveraging datasets from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), we aim to understand trends, establish correlations, and predict future values of these indicators.
